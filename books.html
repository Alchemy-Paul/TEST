<p>over the years, I discovered that for one to grow in wisdom you have to study, read different materials to be well sound and spoken. I find reading fun because when you bury your head to read a book for instance you won't know when you have burned three hours of you time, not to mention study or researching which are my favourite aspect which I don't toy with or like been disturbed or distracted.<br>Even in the bible it is said that "wisdom is the principle thing in all that you do strive to get wisdom"</p>
